================
Grammar with Encoding List for Disambiguation (GELD) Context Free Grammar (CFG) generator
================

IMPORTANT: Code Documentation can be find in "latex" (run make) or "html" dirs. It was created
by Doxyfile based on comments in the code.

1. The GELD version of this programm generates a grammar with certain properties 
given in the Report and an encoding list to decode it, from a given sequence. 

The author of the code is:
Francisco Dorr
fran.dorr@gmail.com

taking parts of Matthias Gallé code from his PhD thesis (all the suffix array things
and the saerch for maximal repeats).

2. Compilation:

I used the boost library, so it should be installed before compilation. For
information how to do it go to: http://www.boost.org/

After that, just type "make" in a terminal in the source folder. 
This will create "main" executable.

3. Basic Usage:

$> ./main <file> [iter] [Output]

where file should be sequence of tokens separate by spaces. For example:
"a g g t g a g g a g t g a g t g a c a c a c a c a c a g g g t g a g a g a c"

is a valid file. Or:

"pep io 142 ioi 122 caci giso po2 20 paos 20 28 sss aggt ass a 20 wrr wg02"

Is also a valid file.

iter: is the number of iterations we want to do. If the grammar couldn't get 
improved it stop without doing all iters. Should be an integer > 2. If no iter is given
it continues until there is no improvement.

[OptionalOutput]: an output file to write grammar information.


As an example there is a file called ecoli in the current dir, run:

$> ./main ecoli 2000 ecoliGram



EXTRA: 
- apostol: executable to run the apostolico approach (SLG)
- contextFirst: executable to select first context and when there's no option select words.
