\chapter{What's next?}

There are many roads to follow from here: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Compression: going a step further, analysing entropy aspects, different 
	types of encoding, etc.
	
	\item Focusing on the heuristic to choose better and faster constituents, to avoid 
	limitations in the size of our dataset.

	\item More approaches besides Greedy. For example, Minimal Grammar Parsing adapted
	to contexts, Graphs Algorithms like the ones showed in the heuristics section, etc.

	\item Theorical formulas to complete the practical experiments. Why it is better 
	to choose words? Why bounding the k,l size gave us almost the same results?

	\item Finding interesting patterns and structures in the final grammar representation
	of the sequences (for example, interesting DNA parts).


	\item Improve one of the approaches (for example, focusing in small sequences with SLID). 
	This could be intereseting for specific types of dna, could be plasmids.
\end{itemize}
