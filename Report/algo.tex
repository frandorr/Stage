\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\REQUIRE $Seq$
\STATE search for Maximal Repeats MR in Seq
\WHILE{$MR \neq \emptyset \land \neg STOP$}
	\STATE search for contexts $\mu_i$ and $\mu_j$ that generate as many yields as possible using Max-Clique in every pair of contexts.
	\STATE check for STOP criteria
	\IF{it's better to use SLG with the most repeated context}
	\STATE Do SLG replace
	\STATE break
	\ENDIF

	% \IF{$n = min(|pos_s(\mu_i)|, |pos_s(\mu_j)|)$}
	% 	\STATE \COMMENT{Canot find yields which occurrences are bigger than actual yield}	
	% 	\STATE $STOP = TRUE$
	% \ENDIF

	% \STATE pick $\max_i (|pos_s(\mu_i)|) \in MR$ 
	% \STATE pick $\max_j (|pos_s(\mu_j)|) \in MR \setminus \{\mu_i\}$
	% \STATE Search for 

	% \STATE $MR \leftarrow MR \setminus \{\mu_j\}$ 


	% \STATE look for best possible composition within context $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ using Graph algorithm or something similar.
	% \STATE asign a score

\ENDWHILE

\STATE Do l,k Grammar replace

\end{algorithm}

There could be many stop criteria based on heuristics or just waiting until we know the yields obtained couldn't get any better
